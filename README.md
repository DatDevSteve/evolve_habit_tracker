# Evolve- A Collaborative Habit Tracker (BETA)

A digital approach towards inculcating good habits

## ℹ️Introduction

Evolve is a digital habit-tracking app that lets you organize your daily habits into a checklist and mark them as completed throughout the day.
Beyond just tracking your personal routines, this app helps you build consistency through a **Streak Score** — which grows each day you successfully complete all your listed habits.
You can also connect with others by adding them to your **Circle**, allowing you to share and follow each other’s habit-building journeys.

## ⚙️The Tech Stack

* **Supabase**: for user management and backend.

## 🛠️ Current Project Status
